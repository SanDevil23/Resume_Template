        <p> Hello! My name is Sankalp Adhya, I am a college student. I have major interest in Coding, Web Development, 3D Designing, etc. I am new at AI, ML and Data Science but I want to dedicate my future in these fields. I take keen interest in working across different platforms, so that I am able to contribute something to this world of science and technology.</p>
        
        <p> From the early days of my schooling, I have interest in computers and their technicalities. </p>
        
        <p>I was introduced to formatting in excel sheets, making powerpoint presentations in secondary school, here I also had hands on the basics of HTML and CSS. Moving further, in Senior secondary school (i.e. XI and XII) I did coding in Python.</p>

        <p> Python was a great experience as it was my first programming language. We explored a lot in python. Libraries like matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc and Stacks and Queues are not at all easy to use. </p>

        <p> In future my goal is to have a great knowledge about data science and machine learning. I want to handle big data and explore it to create newer and efficient technologies. </p>
        <p> I also did some basic in MySQL, where we learnt about database management system. How to handle queries, and make tables. The most interesting part of this was to use the connectivity between Python and MySQL, to directly import data inserted by the user into MySQL Servers.</p>

        <p> Web Development is my free-time friend. Whenever I am free, I try to explore CSS and other web development techniques.</p>
